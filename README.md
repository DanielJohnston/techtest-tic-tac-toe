# techtest-tic-tac-toe
Tech test from Makers Academy - modelling a two player game of Tic Tac Toe

## The brief

The rules of tic-tac-toe are as follows:

* There are two players in the game (X and O)
* Players take turns until the game is over
* A player can claim a field if it is not already taken
* A turn ends when a player claims a field
* A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
* A game is over if a player wins
* A game is over when all fields are taken

Build the business logic for a game of tic tac toe. It should be easy to implement a working game of tic tac toe by combining your code with any user interface, whether web or command line.

## Installation and running

The game is built in Ruby with RSpec testing framework. You'll need `ruby` and `bundler` to be installed on your machine. Download the repo to your machine, run `bundle install`, then run `irb`, and require the various files in the `lib` folder to add the game's classes. Alternatively, require the classes into your own application to provide the game logic for your own interface.
